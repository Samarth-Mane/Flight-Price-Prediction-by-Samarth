**✈️ Real-Time Price vs Predicted Price**

** To evaluate the real-world effectiveness of the model, a comparison was made between the predicted price and actual real-time flight fares from New Delhi to Kochi on 27th July.

🔹 Predicted Price by Model: ₹7,073.77

🔹 Actual Market Price (Air India): ₹6,735 – ₹7,840

✅ The predicted fare of ₹7,073.77 closely aligns with the actual listed prices on popular travel platforms, showcasing the model's strong predictive capability and practical usefulness.
With an R² score of 0.7937 (~79%), the model demonstrates a high level of accuracy in estimating flight prices, making it a valuable tool for price forecasting and travel cost planning. **
